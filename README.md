SMT-guided Metropolis Hastigns

This framework enables direct translation of probabilistic inference tasks into SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) constraint models. It features a modular design for handling probabilistic distributions, supports flexible experimentation with likelihood estimation techniques, and integrates with Metropolis-Hastings (MH) inference, supporting both warm-start and warm-jump strategies.

Installation install Julia, Gen run py-req.sh
